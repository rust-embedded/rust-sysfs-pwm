- [API Documentation](https://docs.rs/sysfs-pwm)

rust-sysfs-pwm is a rust library/crate providing access to the [Linux
sysfs PWM interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/pwm.txt).
It seeks to provide an API that is safe, convenient, and efficient.

## Install/Use

To use `sysfs-pwm`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
# or latest version
sysfs-pwm = "0.2.0"
```

Then, add this to your crate root:

```rust
use sysfs_pwm;
```

## MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.28.0 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

## Example/API

The main API consists of a Pwm struct with the following methods:
* `Pwm::new` - Create a Pwm instance
* `pwm.with_exported` - Execute a block with the Pwm exported
* `pwm.set_active` - Enable/Disable the Pwm
* `pwm.get_duty_cycle` - Get duty cycle as percentage of period
* `pwm.set_duty_cycle` - Set duty cycle as percentage of period
* `pwm.get_duty_cycle_ns` - Get duty cycle in nanoseconds
* `pwm.set_duty_cycle_ns` - Set duty cyle in nanoseconds
* `pwm.get_period_ns` - Get the Pwm period in nanoseconds
* `pwm.set_period_ns` - Set the Pwm period in nanoseconds

Check out the [Breathing LED](examples/breathe.rs) example for a usage
example.

## Cross Compiling

Most likely, the machine you are running on is not your development
machine (although it could be).  In those cases, you will need to
cross-compile.  The [instructions here][rust-cross] provide great details on cross
compiling for your platform.

## Running the Example

Cross-compiling can be done by specifying an appropriate target.  You
can then move that to your device by whatever means and run it.

```
$ cargo build --target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --example breathe
$ scp target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/debug/examples/breathe ...
```
